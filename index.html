<p><center>Welcome to my website and thank you for visiting. I started this website as a way to
have my simple HTML/CSS + Javascript game to be displayed on a website. I've teaching 
myself to code during the summer between my High School graduation and my Freshman year
of college. Below is the link to my game Hassanat Clickers.</center></p>
